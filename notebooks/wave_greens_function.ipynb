    "The functions above only compute the flow and forces around a single shape - they take in **one** `x,y` array pair. How can we compute the flow induced by more than one shape, like a multi-hull ship? Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Superposition:* Can we define the geometries, solve for each flow separately, and then add the flow and forces together? \n",
    "\n",
    "No. If we solve for the flows separately, we will miss the influence of the bodies on each other. When we add them up, the body BC won't be satisfied and so the flow and forces will be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Concatenation:* Can we stack all the body arrays together, and then solve for the flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach includes the influence of each body on the other, but it will also create fake panels linking the bodies together. We need to zero the influence of those non-panels to use this approach - as I've done below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Images:* Can we apply the method of images to reflect the geometry across the $y$ axis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, and this is the classic approach (since it play nice with analytic models) but there are some caveats. Importantly, this only works when you have a plane of symmetry! So you can't use this to model two independent boats - even if the hulls are identical, their motions won't be. "
